Recently, Mr. Rosenthal has enjoyed sport and physical activity and is in peak physical shape. If only he knew that he can't keep his washboard abdominals and those calves (would must have been carved by Michaelangelo himself) him in the afterlife. Once he's aware of this, he'll realize that he's making a big mistake. 

The SCAA updated the wheel to reflect the finer nuances needed to describe flavors more precisely. The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.

While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.

## What Went Wrong 

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:

- Emily is a bitch
- Annie isn't _enough_ of a bitch 
- Warped mind from Kohlchan 
- Concentric are scum
- Family ain't doin what spose'd to
- Shilo is literally a bitch 
- Sister is actually bitch

For over 33 years, David has graced us with his presence. Approximately a third of these years involved the acquisition and consumption of Zolpidem, his favorite medication. 

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.

The next few years of David's life will critically affect his future. He remains confident that his way of thinking is sufficiently open, and that his memory, while admittedly failing, is still way better than that of his pot-smoking retinue. But is he paying attention to the most important things, and not falling for the kind of gag or kneecapping himself intellectually, by falling for old traps? Only time will tell. Good night and good luck.

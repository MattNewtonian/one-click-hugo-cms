In recent memory, subject D.A.R. spends his days shuffling papers around a legal office and waiting around for the signal from above that it's time to make a delivery. He is resourceful and contemplative, choosing to indulge in the occasional documentary on South African geopolitics, or philosophy, or something like that. 

Unfortunately for him, while he is thinking deeply and engaged with teh Tube of You, with his little earbuds nestled in his little ears, a voice rouses him 
He'll leap at the chance to use the paper shredder, which almost feels like work and almost like time-theft (how can something this fun be considered work? Perhaps I should have pivoted to the paper-shredding industry when I had the chance, but now I am at the ripe age of thirty-three, which is significantly older than thirty-two, and much _much_ older than thirty-one. Oh, to be thirty-one again, now that's a great age. But if we're going to play favorites, why don't we just set the clock back to twenty-two, so I can actually bang those two Polish chicks who were into me, and not be a fucking halfafag about this, and why can't I forget about this? My friends don't remember things that I tell them, but I remember everything they've said to me...it feels like a curse of sorts. 

Suddenly, a _womp!_ Special K slammed his table and announced to the room, "I'mma need me a Subway tuna sandwich!" (What I'm thinking is, damn is that not a great advertisement? It's leagues ahead of the old Jared campaign, that guy who, one way or another, lost a bunch of weight from eating Subway sandwiches (but only the yucky low-cal ones), and got arrested and sent to federal pound-me-in-the-ass penitentiary? I feel like Subway's never been the same since.) 

D.A.R. was suddenly startled by his colleague, who goes by the name of Special K. 

The man, born in 1975 but who often claims to be 37, 39, and sometimes 34, is a connoseiur of fine foods, especially iced cream and Subway tuna sandwiches with "justa bit of chicken salad onnit", which he assures are in fact "the bomb". 

Recently, subject known as D.A.R. has enjoyed sport and physical activity and is in peak physical shape. If only he knew that he can't take it with him - those washboard abdominals and those calves (would must have been carved by Michaelangelo himself) will slough off after his demise and not remain with him in the afterlife.

Yet he lives a virtuous life nonetheless. Currently, he's pushing papers around a man named Special K, who has a penchant for ice cream and tuna sandwiches from Subway with "justa bit a chicken salad" onnit
The SCAA updated the wheel to reflect the finer nuances needed to describe flavors more precisely. The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.

While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. Weâ€™ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.

## What Went Wrong 

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:

- Emily is a bitch
- Annie isn't _enough_ of a bitch 
- Warped mind from Kohlchan 
- Concentric are scum
- Family ain't doin what spose'd to
- Shilo is literally a bitch 
- Sister is actually a bitch

For over 33 years, David has graced us with his presence. Approximately a third of these years involved the acquisition and consumption of Zolpidem, his favorite medication. 

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.

The next few years of David's life will critically affect his future. He remains confident that his way of thinking is sufficiently open, and that his memory, while admittedly failing, is still way better than that of his pot-smoking retinue. But is he paying attention to the most important things, and not falling for the kind of gag or kneecapping himself intellectually, by falling for old traps, the kind of traps that only really smart people fall into? Only time will tell. Good night and good luck.
